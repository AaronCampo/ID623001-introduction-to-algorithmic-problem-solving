# 01: AI Strategy - Introduction to chess

In this module, we are going to look at **decision trees** which are a means for **AI** to make decisions about what actions to take. The application of these trees can take many forms depending on the context of the game; we are going to look at a very simple example of an AI weighing up all its options before making its 'move' - **Chess**! Now, Chess itself is not simple... and to play it well, you need a lot of knowledge and practice. But it provides a good example for us for a couple reasons: (1) the rules of the game are very well-defined - there are only certain legal moves that can be made at any turn, so this makes the options available easy to evaluate; and (2) it is turn-based, which will be easier for us to deal with than, say, a real-time game where the state-of-play is constantly updating.
